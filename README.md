Semi-automated product delivery service

0.0 INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION OF OPPORTUNITY

In the past half-century, particularly within the latest decade of this millennium, governments and citizens all around Africa as well as foreign stakeholders especially from China, have undertaken to invest heavily in local and international road transport networks. This has been driven by among other purposes – a deliberate effort towards achieving efficiency in product distribution for stimulation of improved trade relations [citation]. Upgrades of global transport networks have oft been found to be necessary, being a result of the constantly increasing industrial urban population and consequent modern-product demand of citizens.

Due to this trend, inland highways and railway-lines have been built and heavy commercial vehicles continue to be imported with control measures persistently being repealed [citation].

Despite these huge investments, the mission to attain a positive balance of trade by the majority of African institutions remains an elusive dream largely because of the amplified costs incurred in fuel and spare-part imports.

While Motor Vehicle Road Hours (MVRH) are always wasted wasted when measured against efficiency in product distribution by weight [citation?], Free Collection Trips (FCT) and Post-Delivery Return Trips (PDRT) remain high.

Clearly, manufacturers and Transport Service Providers (TSP) have not been properly matched.

A deep inspection into the transport system all around Africa exposes a glaring inefficiency which, if properly patched will lead to great reductions in transportation costs by among other intermediary results, cutting down wasted trips and reducing the number of vehicles using the roads at any given time and optimizing the utilities of Luggage Vehicle Loading (LVL). This project, if implemented, will serve in eliminating traffic jams, giving a boost to road safety, enforcing loading limits, increasing profits for motor-vehicle owners/ operators, creating new jobs, cutting back fuel imports, reducing carbon emissions and generally making life easier for everyone.

Herein is explored a systematic approach based in ICT and semi-automation of LVL towards the attainment of this most noble of goals – zero FCT and PDRT.
